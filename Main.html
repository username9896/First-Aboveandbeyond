        <h4>What is IoT</h4>
        <img src="iot.png" alt="This is an IoT image" style="float:right" width="250px" height="250">
        <p>"Internet of Things" is referred to as IoT. It describes a network of real-world items, such as machinery,
            automobiles, and home appliances, which are equipped with sensors, software, and network connectivity to
            gather and share data with other systems and with one another through the internet. From straightforward
            common items like thermostats and smart watches to more sophisticated machinery and industrial equipment,
            these items can vary widely. They can utilise the data they gather to automate procedures, increase
            productivity, and develop new services and products, as well as to conduct analysis to learn more about
            different facets of their business and surroundings.
            Overall, the Internet of Things (IoT) is a developing industry with a wide range of potential uses and
            advantages, from enhancing health care and transportation to streamlining production and energy use. It also
            brings up significant issues with data privacy, security, and ethics, which demand careful thought and
            attention.</p>
       
        <br>

        <h4>What is an IoT Application</h4>
        <p>A software application or system known as an IoT application leverages data from IoT devices to carry out a
            specified task or offer a service. IoT applications can be created for a range of uses, including tracking
            and optimising industrial equipment, monitoring and managing smart home devices, gathering and analysing
            data from wearables and other health devices, and more. Applications for the Internet of Things frequently
            combine both hardware and software elements. The hardware might consist of internet-connected sensors,
            controllers, and other IoT gadgets for data collection and transmission. The software may include mobile or
            web-based user interfaces that let users engage with the system, cloud-based platforms and analytics tools
            that process and analyse the data.</p>
        <h5>Examples</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Smart Home Devices - The ability to remotely operate IoT-enabled appliances like thermostats, lighting,
                and security systems makes homes more cosy and secure.</li>
            <li>Fitness trackers (Smart Watches)</li>
            <li>intelligent traffic system</li>
            <li>Air Quality Monitoring</li>
            <li>Street Lighting</li>
            <li>Health Care - In order to help clinicians make informed treatment decisions, wearable technology can be
                utilised to remotely monitor patient health.</li>
        </ul>
